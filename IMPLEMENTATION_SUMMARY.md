# UnlockOpenFile Implementation Summary

## Overview
UnlockOpenFile is a Windows application that solves the file locking problem when opening files with applications like Excel. Instead of locking the original file, it creates a temporary copy, opens it, monitors for changes, and synchronizes back to the original file.

## Requirements Met

### ✅ Core Functionality
1. **파일 복사 및 열기 (File Copy and Open)**
   - Creates temporary copy in system temp folder
   - Opens copy with default application (Excel, etc.)
   - Original file remains unlocked for other programs
   
2. **자동 동기화 (Automatic Synchronization)**
   - FileSystemWatcher monitors temp file for changes
   - 500ms debounce to handle multiple write operations
   - Automatic retry logic for locked files
   - Changes are saved back to original file automatically

3. **Windows OS 지원 (Windows OS Support)**
   - Built with .NET 8.0 for Windows
   - WinForms application with native Windows UI
   - Windows 10+ compatibility

4. **파일 연결 (File Association)**
   - Register as default program for .xlsx and .csv files
   - Uses HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry (no admin rights needed)
   - Custom ProgId for each file type
   - Easy registration/unregistration through Settings UI

5. **시작 프로그램 등록 (Startup Registration)**
   - Register to run at Windows startup
   - Uses HKEY_CURRENT_USER\...\Run registry key
   - No admin rights required
   - Toggle on/off from Settings UI

6. **무료 소프트웨어 (Free Software)**
   - Open source implementation
   - No paid components or dependencies
   - Uses only free .NET Framework and Windows APIs

## Architecture

### Components

```
UnlockOpenFile/
├── Program.cs              # Entry point, argument handling
├── FileManager.cs          # Core file operations and monitoring
├── FileOpenerForm.cs       # Main UI for file operations
├── SettingsForm.cs         # Settings and registration UI
├── app.manifest           # Windows manifest
└── UnlockOpenFile.csproj  # Project configuration
```

### FileManager.cs
**Responsibilities:**
- Copy original file to temp location
- Open file with default application
- Monitor file changes using FileSystemWatcher
- Synchronize changes back to original
- Cleanup temp files on exit

**Key Methods:**
- `OpenFileAsync()` - Creates copy and opens file
- `StartFileWatcher()` - Sets up file monitoring
- `OnFileChanged()` - Handles file change events
- `SaveToOriginalAsync()` - Syncs changes to original
- `Cleanup()` - Removes temporary files

### FileOpenerForm.cs
**Responsibilities:**
- Display file operation status
- System tray integration
- Real-time logging of operations
- User feedback and notifications

**Features:**
- Status text box with timestamps
- System tray icon with context menu
- Balloon notifications on file save
- Minimize to tray support

### SettingsForm.cs
**Responsibilities:**
- File association management
- Startup registration
- User preferences
- Registry operations

**Features:**
- Checkbox for startup registration
- Buttons for file type association
- Operation logging
- User-friendly error messages

## Technical Details

### File Monitoring
- Uses `FileSystemWatcher` for change detection
- Monitors `LastWrite` and `Size` changes
- 500ms debounce to avoid multiple triggers
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

### Temporary File Naming
```
{OriginalName}_copy_{Timestamp}.{Extension}
```
Example: `report_copy_638349123456789.xlsx`

### Registry Locations
**File Association:**
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\.xlsx
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\UnlockOpenFile.xlsx
```

**Startup Registration:**
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

### Error Handling
- Input validation in constructors
- Try-catch blocks around all I/O operations
- User-friendly error messages in Korean
- Retry logic for file locking conflicts
- Graceful degradation on failures

## Build Information

### Dependencies
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Windows Forms (Microsoft.NET.Sdk)
- No external NuGet packages required

### Build Commands
```bash
# Debug build
dotnet build

# Release build
dotnet build -c Release

# Publish for distribution
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -o ./publish
```

### Output
- Executable: `UnlockOpenFile.exe`
- Size: ~150KB (without runtime)
- Target Framework: net8.0-windows

## Testing Notes

### Manual Testing Checklist
Since this is a Windows-only application built on Linux, testing requires Windows:

1. **Basic File Opening**
   - [ ] Open .xlsx file with UnlockOpenFile
   - [ ] Verify temp file is created
   - [ ] Verify Excel opens the temp file
   - [ ] Verify original file is not locked

2. **File Synchronization**
   - [ ] Edit file in Excel
   - [ ] Save in Excel
   - [ ] Verify changes appear in original file
   - [ ] Check status log shows synchronization

3. **File Association**
   - [ ] Register .xlsx association
   - [ ] Double-click .xlsx file in Explorer
   - [ ] Verify UnlockOpenFile opens it
   - [ ] Unregister and verify default behavior restored

4. **Startup Registration**
   - [ ] Enable startup registration
   - [ ] Restart Windows
   - [ ] Verify program runs in background
   - [ ] Check system tray for icon

5. **Edge Cases**
   - [ ] Open file with spaces in name
   - [ ] Open file with special characters
   - [ ] Open very large file (100MB+)
   - [ ] Open file from network drive
   - [ ] Open file while original is read-only

## Known Limitations

1. **Platform**: Windows 10+ only
2. **File Size**: Large files may take time to copy
3. **Sync Delay**: 500ms minimum delay for change detection
4. **Temp Space**: Requires sufficient space in temp folder
5. **Testing**: Cannot be fully tested on Linux build environment

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

These were not required but could be added:
- Multi-language support (currently Korean only)
- Configurable sync delay
- Support for more file types
- Network file optimization
- Conflict resolution UI
- File history/versioning
- Settings persistence in config file
